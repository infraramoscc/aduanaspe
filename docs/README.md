# Documentation Root

Welcome to the project documentation. This folder is organized to separate technical maintenance from marketing content and service definitions.

## Folder Structure

- **[`services/`](./services/index.md)**: Only for Service definitions. Each service has its own file.
- **[`marketing/`](./marketing/seo-strategy.md)**: For SEO strategies, ad copy, and campaign tracking.
  - `marketing/copy/`: Drafts for page copy.
  - `marketing/campaigns/`: Specific campaign details.
- **[`ui/`](./ui/design-system.md)**: Design System, Component Guidelines, and SEO/UX requirements.
- **[`architecture/`](./architecture/project-structure.md)**: Technical guides, project structure, and deployment.

## Getting Started

1. To add a new service, use the [Service Template](./services/service-template.md).
